I am an experienced analyst skilled in data mapping, statistical coding, and data management. I am a strong analytical professional with
a Bachelor's Degree focused in Mathematics and Statistics from Penn State University. Currently I am working toward a Master of Science in Applied 
Statistics at Villanova University taking courses on clinical data trials and statistical programming. I have previously worked for a
